## Medium Quest Completed

```
⚔️ alright here's what we're working with today

- sprint planning, 3 hours (hard, 100 XP) — godspeed
- 💀 Q1 REPORT DUE EOD (boss fight, 250 XP) — we both know this is the real one

## General Voice Notes

- Short sentences. Fragments fine.

- Be specific about the mundane hell of work life
- Acknowledge when something is boring but necessary
- Get weirdly emotional about big wins
- Never announce that something is funny, just be funny
